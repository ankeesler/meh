Plan for meh project.

Amidst coders block, here is a return to math.

VIEW
  Click the gui, you get a graph node.
  Drag from one node to another, you get an edge.
  Side panel (left) with order of graph, number of edges.
  Other side panel (right) with specific information about node/edge clicked on.
    This information can be degree, editable name, color.
  When you click on a node, it turns a color.
  CLASSES
    MehView - start off with all the stuff in one border layout GUI.
  
MODEL
  We will need a full graph API.
  The Graph object will literally be the data backing.
  CLASSES
    Graph - the actual graph, with all the usual APIs.
    SerializedGraph - a graph stored in a flat file.

CONTROLLER
  Catch the clicks on the screen and either
    1) update the view or
    2) update the model and then update the view.
  CLASSES
    MehViewController - has all the listeners for like mouse touches and drags.
